How to create 2 VMs communicating between them:
1) sh vnet-setup.sh [-B <vnet name>] [-V <vnet name>] -n 2 -z
	Notes:
	"-B ..." allows to create a bridge-based vnet (provides a
        backward learning algorithm).
	"-V ..." allows to create a vnet that is not connected with
	any physical eth* interface.
	"-n 2" creates 2 interfaces
	"-z" enables an experimental zerocopy feature in vhost-net (might
	increase performance)
2) sh setkvm.sh
3) sh startvm.sh -K -n -t -i macvtap0
4) sh startvm.sh -K -n -t -i macvtap1
5) Change the IP address in the second VM before pinging...
